<p>Welcome to my portfolio repository built with NextJS 13, a popular React-based framework for building fast and dynamic web applications. This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer, and includes responsive design, smooth page transitions, and optimized performance thanks to NextJS's built-in features such as Server-Side Rendering, Incremental Static Regeneration, and Image Optimization. Feel free to browse the code, clone the repository, and customize it to fit your own needs. Happy coding!</p>
